# ecs36b_s2020
I will use this folder to share all the code segments presented in the classes/lectures/discussions.
Please remember that to learn well in any programming courses, we have to get our hands on the programs themselves, which is the only way to truly learn. Therefore, after watching the video, you should try what we covered there. If you have any questions or encounter any road blocks, we (the instructor, the TAs, and others in the class) are here to help.

Also, homework and project folder for ecs36b during the Sprint quarter of 2020 will be placed here as well.
